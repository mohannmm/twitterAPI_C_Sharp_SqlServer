This was me and my team's first go at an implementation of the twitter api. 
We used a c# web app to do so, and we used a sqlserver database because it was a database class. 
We were attempting to create a "political bias calculator", by storing a bunch of political keywords in the database, and doing some arbitrary calculation.
It gave results... not very accurate results.

We didn't really know about machine learning at the time, and this project would have well suited for a machine learning implmentation.
